# tax-distributions
tax-distributions contains the federal tax burden distribution information by income decile from 2015 to 2019. The script allows the user to plot both income distribution by decile and federal tax burden distribution by decile and examine each decile's share. Types of federal taxes that have distributions computed for are the following: individual income, corporate income, payroll, excise and customs duties, and estate and gift taxes. The data is published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Tax Analysis. 

The intent is to allow the user to examine the progressivity and regressivity of different components of the U.S. federal tax system.

The app can be generated locally by downloading the necessary .xlsx files and using the script on your desktop. Additionally, the app can be found here:
